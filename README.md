# llama3-go: Native Llama Inference in Go

## Project Overview

The **`llama3-go`** package is an ambitious, ongoing effort to implement native Llama inference capabilities directly within the Go programming language. This project aims to provide a lightweight, efficient platform for running a range of large language models (LLMs) from within Go applications.

### **Current Status: Pre-Alpha Development (Highly Experimental)**

This repository is currently under active, intensive development. **It is not yet production-ready, nor is it suitable for general use.**

* **Compilation/Build Status:** The package may not successfully compile or link due to incomplete dependencies and ongoing architectural refactoring.
* **Known Issues:** The codebase contains numerous known bugs, incomplete features, and potential memory management inefficiencies that are being actively addressed.
* **Stability:** The internal architecture and public API are highly unstable and subject to frequent, breaking changes without deprecation cycles.

I am dedicating consistent effort to resolve these issues and stabilize the codebase to achieve feature parity for basic inference functionality.

### **Request for Collaboration**

I welcome contributions from experienced Go developers who are interested in low-level performance and machine learning implementation. Collaboration is crucial to accelerating the stabilization and optimization of this project.

Areas where assistance would be particularly valuable include:

* Resolving current compilation and build pipeline errors.
* Implementing and verifying core model components (e.g., attention mechanisms, normalization layers).
* Profiling and optimizing performance critical sections.
* Developing comprehensive unit and integration test coverage.

Please refer to the **Issues** section for specific tasks or open a new discussion to propose a focused contribution.
